    "# Track ARs at consecutive time steps to form tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tracks detected ARs at individual time steps to form tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, assume we have detected $n$ ARs at time $t$, and $m$ ARs at time $t+1$. There are theoretically $n \\times m$ possible associations to link these two groups of ARs. Of cause not all of them are meaningful. The rules that are applied in the association process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **nearest neighbor** principle: for any AR at time $t$, the nearest AR at time $t+1$ \"wins\" and is associated with it, subject to that:\n",
    "2. the **inter-AR distance (H)** is $\\le 1200 \\, km$.\n",
    "3. no merging or splitting is allowed, any AR at time $t$ can only be linked to one AR at time $t+1$, similarly, any AR at time $t+1$ can only be linked to one AR at time $t$.\n",
    "4. after all associations at any give time point have been created, any left-over AR at time $t+1$ forms a track on their own, and waits to be associated in the next iteration between $t+1$ and $t+2$.\n",
    "5. all tracks that do not get updated during the $t$ - $t+1$ process terminates. This assumes that no gap in the track is allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining important question is how to define that **inter-AR distance (H)**. Here we adopt a modified *Hausdorff distance* definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\tH(A,B) \\equiv min \\{ h_f(A,B), h_b(A,B) \\}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H(A, B)$ is the *modified Hausdorff distance* from track $A$ to track $B$,\n",
    "$h_f(A,B)$ is the *forward Hausdorff distance* from $A$ to $B$, and $h_b(A,B)$ the *backward Hausdorff distance* from $A$ to $B$. They are defined, respectively, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\th_f(A, B) \\equiv \\operatorname*{max}_{a \\in A} \\{ \\operatorname*{min}_{b \\in B} \\{\n",
    "\t\td_g(a,b) \\} \\}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "namely, the largest great circle distance of all distances from a point in $A$ to the\n",
    "closest point in $B$. And the backward Hausdorff distance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\th_b(A, B) \\equiv \\operatorname*{max}_{b \\in B} \\{ \\operatorname*{min}_{a \\in A} \\{\n",
    "\t\td_g(a,b) \\} \\}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in general $h_f \\neq h_b$. Unlike the standard definition of\n",
    "Hausdorff distance that takes the maximum of $h_f$ and $h_b$, we take the\n",
    "minimum of the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind this modification is that merging/splitting of ARs mostly\n",
    "happen in an end-to-end manner, during which a sudden increase/decrease in the\n",
    "length of the AR induce misalignment among the anchor points. Specifically,\n",
    "merging (splitting) tends to induce large backward (forward) Hausdorff\n",
    "distance.  Therefore $min \\{ h_f(A,B), h_b(A,B) \\}$ offers a more faithful\n",
    "description of the spatial closeness of ARs. For merging/splitting events in a\n",
    "side-to-side manner, this definition works just as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In production you can use the `scripts/trace_ARs.py` for this step.\n",
