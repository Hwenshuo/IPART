    "# AR detection and tracking algorithms, example application on ERA-I data\n",
    "\n",
    "This page serves as an overview to this notebook series, which as a whole illustrates the application of the Top-hat by Reconstruction (THR) Atmospheric River (AR) detection and subsequent tracking, using the ERA-I reanalysis data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation and configuration of the Python environment, please follow the README at the github page: https://github.com/ihesp/AR_tracker.\n",

    "This notebook will load the test data (the u- and v- components of vertically integrated vapor fluxes) and compute the their magnitude as the Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data, and the computed IVT are saved to the same folder as the notebook file, and will be used in subsequent analyses.\n",
